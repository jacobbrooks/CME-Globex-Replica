# CME-Globex-Replica
My best faith attempt at implementing a java-based replica of the CME Globex Electronic Trading System, based on the CME's publicly available [client systems wiki](https://cmegroupclientsite.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EPICSANDBOX/overview?homepageId=457314687) documentation.

# Build Instructions
This is implemented as a gradle project. To build and run tests, in the root project directory enter:
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```
